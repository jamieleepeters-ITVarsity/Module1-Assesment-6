 <p>One of the most common names for a koala that you may have heard is the “koala bear”.

While their round ears and soft fur may certainly cause them to look like a bear, these two couldn’t be further apart. They are actually a marsupial.

3. Baby koalas eat their mother’s fecal matter
For as cute as they are, koalas do have some rather icky facts. One of them? After they have been weaned off milk, young koalas (known as joeys) will eat their mother’s fecal matter before they switch to eating leaves on their own. 1

While it may seem gross, koalas aren’t the only species to do this: pandas, hippos, and even elephants are known for doing the same. And there’s some science behind it. Consuming their mother’s waste allows for young mammals to develop strong gut bacteria that will help them with digestion in the future.One of the most common names for a koala that you may have heard is the “koala bear”.
