 <p>Giant pandas have specific needs and they include having at least two species of bamboo and a water source contained within an old-growth conifer forest. This type of forest offers large tree stumps and hollow logs that are the right size for panda dens. The other benefits to this type of habitat are that shelter and nutrients are present for the bamboo that grows there.

The giant panda was once widespread throughout China, and even Myanmar and northern Vietnam. However, they have been on the endangered species list from 1990 to 2016, before this was switched to vulnerable – mainly due to habitat loss, poaching and poor breeding.

The giant panda can now only be found in 20 isolated patches of bamboo forest in six mountain ranges in China’s Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, with most in the Minshan and Qinling mountains.</p>
