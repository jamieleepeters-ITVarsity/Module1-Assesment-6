 <p>Gorillas are part of the great ape family, which includes orangutans, bonobos and chimpanzees. They are predominantly ground dwelling, and inhabit forests located in numerous countries in central Africa.

Gorillas are third in line as the closest relatives to the human. Chimpanzees take first place followed by bonobos. They are the largest living primates today.Interesting Gorilla Facts
1. Of the two species of gorillas, each has two lowland and upland subspecies.
The western gorilla is split into two different subspecies including the Cross River gorilla and the Western Lowland gorilla. The eastern gorilla species includes the Mountain gorilla, and Eastern Lowland or Grauerâ€™s gorilla.

2. The two subspecies have very different habitats.
The gorilla is mostly restricted to countries in central Sub-Saharan Africa, but the various subspecies live in different elevations. The mountain gorillas are known to inhabit higher elevations up to 4,300 metres above sea level. The lowlands species tend to stay near the valley floor in the thick rain forests on the Atlantic Coast of Africa.

3. Of the various subspecies of gorillas, two have small populations left on the planet.
The Cross River gorilla contains about 250 animals still in the wild restricted to a small border area between Nigeria and Cameroon, making them the worlds rarest ape. The Mountain gorilla is also severely endangered with an estimated 880 still alive today. There are estimates of fewer than 5,000 Eastern Lowland gorillas, and over 100,000 Western Lowland gorillas in existence. </p>
